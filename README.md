# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Using Javascipt, HTML, and CSS this page creates a daily work scheduler. It has the current date and hour boxes from 8am-6pm. When the user types an entry and clicks save it will save to the users plan to storage. The boxes are colored based on the time of day. When an hour box is in the past it will turn gray. When it is the current hour it will be red. All other hour boxes in the future hours will be green. As time passes the color of boxes will change but the plan entry will stay the same if saved.
